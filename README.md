# Gesture-Control-For-Volume-Adjustment
The Hand Gesture Volume Control system is a Python-based project that leverages computer vision and hand tracking to control system volume using hand gestures. This interactive application detects hand landmarks in real-time, analyzes the distance between specific landmarks, and adjusts the system volume accordingly.

### Hand Tracking:
Utilizes the Mediapipe library for accurate hand tracking and landmark detection.

### Gesture-based Volume Control:
Defines hand gestures for controlling system volume by measuring the distance between key landmarks.
Volume adjusts dynamically based on hand gestures in the camera's field of view.

### Real-time Feedback:
Displays live feedback on the screen, including hand landmarks, drawn lines between specific points, and a volume bar.
