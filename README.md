# Gesture-Control-For-Volume-Adjustment
The Hand Gesture Volume Control system is a Python-based project that leverages computer vision and hand tracking to control system volume using hand gestures. This interactive application detects hand landmarks in real-time, analyzes the distance between specific landmarks, and adjusts the system volume accordingly.
